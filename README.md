# fishfeeder
An Arduino-based automatic fish feeder. The feeder is a bottle of food mounted horizontally (but slightly tilted so that food slides towards the bottom). A servo motor is attachde to the lid. The bottom of the bottle has a slot cut into it with a cover glued over it. This allows some food slide out when the bottle is rotated by the servo. In the resting position, the slot should be near the top.

A video of my feeder can be seen [here](media/feeder.mp4?raw=true).
